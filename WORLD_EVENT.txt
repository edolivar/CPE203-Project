1) To trigger the event, click anywhere on the screen.

2) When the event has been triggered, whatever
   entity at the point that you clicked will be removed,
   and at that point will be spawned a Shadow Mage. Along
   with this shadow mage will be a large radius of purple
   slime that spawns with the mage. After the mage and all
   of his slime has spawned, he will go on a rampage to infect
   every MinerNotFull that he can find. The Shadow Mage is 
   the fastest entity in the world, and only thirsts for the blood
   of MinerNotFulls. Wherever the mage goes, he will leave a
   trail of purple slime behind him, making his path very clear.

3) The infected MinerNotFulls become the Shadow Mage's zombie slaves.
   They are called Shadow Miners (really original, right?). These are
   the slowest entities in the world. Once infected, these Shadow
   Miners will morph into a purple-ish version of the original
   Miner (which sucked to draw 5 times), and will very slowly seek out
   every available Blacksmith it can. When it finds a blacksmith, it
   will kill it. It only seeks Blacksmiths, doesn't care about anything
   else, and will kill and remove the Blacksmiths as soon as they can.
   The Shadow Miner's only goal in life is to ruin the game for everyone
   else in their merciless rampage.

4) The new entity, the ShadowMage, will go around at the fastest pace
   infecting MinerNotFulls. It doesn't care for blobs or anything else,
   all it wants to do is build an army of zombie MinerNotFulls. Once it
   has infected every possible MinerNotFull it can find, it will stop
   moving and look upon his epic army. He leaves a trail of slime, as
   mentioned before, wherever he goes.
